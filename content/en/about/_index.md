Hi! Welcome to my journal. I am an undergraduate student in Biomedical Science at the University of Ottawa. I have 
always been interested in research specifically the process of going from a topic to designing experiements that will 
yield valid conclusions. Here, I will be taking a look at different scientific papers on a variety of topics and sharing 
my thoughts and ideas.
