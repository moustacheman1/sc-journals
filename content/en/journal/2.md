As the world awaits vaccine roll-out for the COVID-19 virus, the fight against the pandemic continues. Vaccines have been the optimal solution to many infectious and non-infectious diseases. This treatment involves exposing your body to a safe amount of the disease for your body to develop specific antigens against the virus, resulting in immunity. Within the 21st century, the significance of preventing the spread of infectious diseases resulted in the development of many vaccines as a treatment for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Upon recently, vaccines and their development are pointing in the direction of cancer treatment.

Unlike the infectious nature of HIV and tuberculosis, cancer is an illness caused by the overproduction of cells that results in either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) tumours. Currently, common cancer treatments involve surgery (removal of the tumour), radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Many of these treatments are costly and come with many side effects depending on the type of treatments and the stage of cancer of the patient. However, cancer vaccines offer less intrusive options that do not require month-long treatments and have the potential to minimize the side effects. 

The development of cancer vaccines involved various tests conducted on mouse models to mimic human immune response. In the beginning, whole tumour cells that were previously removed and or inactive were injected into mouse models inducing an immune response. Tumour cells, that mimic human tumours, did not produce the same results within the mouse models. Research has led to the vaccine created using the antigens (biological markers) found on the surface of tumour cells. Studies found that tumour cells have distinct antigens on their surface suggesting biological indicators that may induce an immune response when identified. Injecting a vaccine containing small, controlled amounts of tumour antigens can reduce the size of the tumour. Though many various strategies have been tested, with varying degrees of effectiveness, many promising results have been achieved through the use of agents that increase the likelihood that the human immune system can recognize the antigen.



Although promising results were recorded in a petri dish, there are limited clinical trials with successful results. Cancer vaccine developed to treat prostate cancer resulted in a 22% reduction in the risk of death, however more effective when combined with additional therapies. Clinical trials for various other types of cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and melanoma, observed a longer duration of survival in patients treated with the vaccine compared to a placebo-administered control group. Additional clinical trials are required to develop a successful vaccine. 

Currently, the anti-tumour vaccine has to undergo numerous testing and clinical trials to develop a universal application. However, the cancer vaccine may prove to be the solution in our fight against cancer and to save millions of lives.
