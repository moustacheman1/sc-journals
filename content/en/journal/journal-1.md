title: "Osteoarthritis - Is there a treatment?"
---

From general lack of exercise to obesity and an ageing population, osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of 
arthritis hindering the activity of more than 303 million individuals around the world in 2017. Osteoarthritis is a 
disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, made of elastic tissue, found between the bones at joints such as 
the hands, the hips and knees. Consequently, patients with OA experience lots of pain and limited mobility which impedes
daily activities. There are few treatment options such as exercise, mediation or joint replacement surgery yet, there 
are no viable cures or modifying disease treatments. Nevertheless, researchers Yulong Wei, Lijun Luo and colleagues 
have published a [study](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/576/eabb3946) exploring the over-activation of a 
cartilage-specific receptor to reduce cartilage degradation in OA patients.

The experiment consists of over-activating a cartilage-specific receptor in mouse models. This receptor has strong 
evidence that it is responsible for maintaining a balance between the cartilage cells for proper function. The mice 
are useful and ethical models where the researchers can test and observe the progression of OA. Over-activation of the 
receptor presented more resilient cells with a greater survival rate within the cartilage. Through surgery, the 
researchers attempted to mimic the deterioration of the cartilage that characterizes OA. Researchers found that the 
cartilage was resilient against surgical destabilization. Furthermore, the mouse models are tested with an inhibitor 
that would prevent the receptor activity. Consequently, the mouse models became susceptible to OA deterioration as the 
cells observed less cell division, thus a minimal survival rate without the cartilage-specific receptor. Ultimately, 
the inhibitor reinforces that the over-activation of the cartilage-specific receptor is responsible for the resilient
nature of cartilage against joint disease. Additionally, the researchers designed a way for a growth factor to arrive 
at target cartilage and over-activate the receptor effectively. The method was able to deliver the growth factor to the 
target directly with limited contact to other areas and observed long retention in the target area. This method can be 
utilized for drug delivery at low doses that can effectively over-activate the cartilage-specific receptor.

Surprisingly, a common disease like osteoarthritis would lack any cures or efficient treatments, since it impacts the 
masses. However, it appears that osteoarthritis does not always present itself clearly, with many individuals who 
experience varying degrees due to several causes. In some studies, there is evidence that OA is a greater possibility 
in some demographics which, may influence treatment options. 

There is still a large amount of research and exploration required within this field, particularly with an impactful 
disease such as OA, however researchers Yulong Wei, Lijun Luo and colleagues have been able to find a possible target 
with promising results.
